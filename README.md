# 📊 Store Finance Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

## 🔎 Business Problem

Retail leadership lacked a centralized view of financial performance across:
- Stores
- Regions
- Countries
- Sales Representatives
- Products
- Time (Year, Quarter, Month)

Key challenges:
- No single source of truth for revenue metrics
- Difficult to compare store and regional performance
- Hard to identify top-performing sales reps
- No clear visibility into revenue trends over time
- Limited ability to drill down into transactions

This led to slow decision-making and missed revenue optimization opportunities.
